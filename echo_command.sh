       documentation for details about the options it supports.

##We used echo -e to produce the input sequence. The -e option signals to echo to interpret escape sequences. 
If the input is large we can use an input file and the redirection operator to supply input:
$ echo -e "notes\ndocx\n" > input.data
$ cat input.data
